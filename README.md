Exercise for using Session-Variable in PHP

The website is an exercise in using as many input types as possible to ultimately store data in the database.
Any framework should be avoided and only HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and PHP should be used.
The data should be retained in the forms when you go to the next or to the previous page being able to edit them.
This ability is achieved by using the session variable. At the last submit, the data is then saved persistently in the database.
